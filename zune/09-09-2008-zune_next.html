<p class="article-strap">Software update will enable Zune users to tag songs and buy music directly from FM radio and download and stream music on the go beginning Sept. 16.</p>
<p class="article-folio">By <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/sep08/09-08ZuneFallUpdatePR.mspx">Microsoft Corporation</a>, Published 8th September 2008</p>

<p><b>REDMOND, Wash. - Sept 8, 2008</b>
Zune, Microsoft Corp.'s end-to-end music and entertainment service, again revolutionises how customers discover and connect to the music they love, 
where and how they want it. Starting next week, every Zune portable media player will let consumers wirelessly download or stream millions of songs 
on the go from thousands of wireless hot spots around the country. Free, powerful software and firmware updates will give Zune owners the ability 
to discover, tag and purchase songs directly from the built-in FM radio, wirelessly access the Zune Marketplace store on the go, and tap into 
interactive, personalised music recommendations that add even more value to the Zune Pass subscription. Zune is also expanding its device 
lineup with new 16GB and 120GB capacities as well as shiny new blue-on-silver and sleek all-black color schemes. The new features will 
begin rolling out on Sept. 16, 2008.
</p>
<p>
"Digital music services really come alive when they help people find not only the music they know they like, but the music they didn't know they would love," 
said Chris Stephenson, general manager of Global Marketing for Zune at Microsoft. "With the combination of subscription, wireless access to millions of 
tracks, and powerful discovery features like personal recommendations and the ability to buy music from FM radio, Zune is taking the digital 
music experience to the next level."
</p>
<p><b>Wireless Connections</b></p>
<p>
More than 61 percent of people say they discover new music by listening to the radio.<sup>1</sup> With that in mind, Zune is taking advantage of the 
wireless connection and the built-in FM tuner to deliver a new feature called Buy from FM, which lets customers tag and purchase songs 
they hear on FM radio stations<sup>2</sup> directly from the Zune device. When the customer is in a Wi-Fi hot spot, the song can be immediately 
downloaded to the Zune device. If Wi-Fi is not available, the device will have a queue of songs ready to download when connected to a home 
computer or in a hot spot. Buy from FM uses Radio Data System and RT+ data feeds within the FM broadcast frequencies that identify song and 
artist data and enable the Zune service to identify and deliver the track to the customer. 
</p>
<p>
"Microsoft's decision to integrate an FM tuner into the Zune was revolutionary and they continue their extraordinary leadership with Buy from FM," said 
John Hogan, president and CEO of Clear Channel Radio. "We've always known that radio is the primary source for discovering new music, and Microsoft's 
decision to marry music discovery and delivery does two things: enables consumers to instantly satisfy their passion and enables FM song tagging to be 
enjoyed by all radio listeners, everywhere."
</p>
<p>
In addition, users can now access the Zune Marketplace music store directly from their device when they are in a recognised Wi-Fi hot spot, or through a 
home wireless network. To make it easy to discover music on the go, customers can browse lists of featured new releases and top songs and albums sorted 
by genre, or use the on-screen keypad to type in the song of their choice. Once they have picked a track or album, they can either download it or stream 
it directly to the Zune device.
</p>
<p>
Zune customers have a choice in how they acquire music: They can pay per track or choose a Zune Pass subscription. Zune Pass subscribers can download 
or stream music to the device or their computer interchangeably, all for a flat rate of $14.99 per month. So whether a device has 4 GB or 120 GB of storage, 
Zune Pass customers can access and stream millions of songs directly to their Zune. 
</p>
<p><b>More Ways to Discover Music: Channels and Picks</b></p>
<p>
The new Zune software update taps expert sources, recommendations from the Zune service and online music community, and the user's own play data to 
create a dynamic, digital music experience where discovering music is easy and seamless. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Channels.</b> Channels are an exciting new tool for music discovery. Customers can explore channels programmed by experts from the music 
industry such as the Billboard Top 100, The FADER magazine and KEXP radio, in addition to workout-themed channels tailored for high, medium 
and low impact, and top chart channels from all genres and subgenres. The powerful Zune software will even create custom channels for each user, 
based on favourite artists and genres. Channels are included with a monthly Zune Pass subscription and can be synced to the device for playback 
on the go. For non-Zune Pass subscribers, the Channels are available for a la carte purchase.</li>
<li><b>Personal Picks.</b> Now the Zune software learns what kind of music users like and makes personal recommendations. When users log onto 
Zune Marketplace, they’ll find a new area called Picks where the Zune recommendation algorithm will suggest artists, albums and tracks based 
on the music they have been listening to, as well as channels they might like and listeners like them in the Zune Social.</li>
<li><b>The Zune Social online music community.</b> Customers can connect with millions of like-minded fans and share music via the Zune Card, 
a real-time playlist of each user's favourite and recently played tracks that can be accessed on the Web or within the Zune software, or synced 
to the Zune device. Zune Pass subscribers can play full tracks from Zune Cards synced to their device while on the go, and now the playlists 
will even automatically update with the most recently played tracks when Zune connects to a wireless hot spot. It's like subscribing to a free 
feed of music from the sources people trust most - their friends.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Powerful Software</b></p>
<p>
The Zune PC software is a free download at <a href="http://www.zune.net">http://www.zune.net</a> that provides rich discovery and media management 
capabilities to help consumers make the most of their existing music collections, in addition to providing access to the Zune Social and 
Zune Marketplace so they can add to it.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mixview.</b> Customers can select an artist, album or Zune Card to activate a dynamic, visual mosaic of related music and listeners. 
With each click users can take the view in a new direction, creating a fun, graphical way to discover new music. Mixview works with users' 
current collection of music, in addition to tracks and albums from across the Zune Marketplace.</li>
<li><b>Now Playing.</b> The improved Now Playing view is more interactive and cinematic. Users can sit back and enjoy the combination of 
great artist imagery, colorful effects, bio information and data from the Zune online music community, all combined in a full-screen view. 
They can also click to dive deeper into the music behind the picture, providing another great way to interact with their collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>A new firmware update will also improve the experience on the Zune device. In addition to the new wireless functionality, 
Zune will bring new features customers have been asking for:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Games on the go.</b> Two free games, "Hexic" and "Texas Hold 'Em", will keep users entertained on the go.</li>
<li><b>Audiobooks.</b> All Zune devices will feature support for audiobooks this fall from industry leaders in the 
digital distribution of audiobook content.</li>
<li><b>Audible.</b> Customers can visit audible.com to download and sync favorite books from the 50,000 titles 
available from over 600 publishers and content providers.</li>
<li><b>OverDrive.</b> They can download content from sites powered by overdrive.com, including 7,500 libraries' 
Web sites worldwide. (<a href="http://search.overdrive.com">http://search.overdrive.com</a>)</li>

<p><sup>1</sup> According to a Kelton Research study sponsored by Zune (April 2008)</p> 
<p><sup>2</sup> The song needs to be available in Zune Marketplace for consumers to purchase it. If it is not available, 
but the radio station is broadcasting the song's meta data, consumers can tag the song (so they can remember the name and artist), 
but will not be able to purchase it.</p>
