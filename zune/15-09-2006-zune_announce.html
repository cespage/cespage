<p class="article-strap">Built-in wireless technology lets consumers share experiences device to device.</p>
<p class="article-folio">By <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/sep06/09-14ZuneUnveilingPR.mspx">Microsoft Corporation</a>, Published 14th September 2006</p>
<p><b>REDMOND, Wash. - Sept. 14, 2006</b>
Marking the next big milestone for its Connected Entertainment vision, Microsoft Corp. today unveiled details of the first products to be released under its 
Zune&trade; brand. Designed around the principles of sharing, discovery and community, Zune will create new ways for consumers to connect and share entertainment 
experiences. The Zune experience centers around connection - connection to your library, connection to friends, connection to community and connection to other devices. 
"The digital music entertainment revolution is just beginning," said J Allard, vice president, design and development, at Microsoft, who is leading the charge for 
building the family of Zune products. "With Zune, we are not simply delivering a portable device, we are introducing a new platform that helps bring artists closer 
to their audiences and helps people find new music and develop new social connections."
</p>
<p><b>The Zune Experience</b></p>
<p>Available this holiday season in the United States, Zune includes a 30GB digital media player, the Zune Marketplace music service and a foundation for an online 
community that will enable music fans to discover new music. The Zune device features wireless technology, a built-in FM tuner and a bright, 3-inch screen that 
allows users to not only show off music, pictures and video, but also to customize the experience with personal pictures or themes to truly make the device their own. 
Zune comes in three colors: black, brown and white. 
Every Zune device creates an opportunity for connection. Wireless Zune-to-Zune sharing lets consumers spontaneously share full-length sample tracks of select songs, 
homemade recordings, playlists or pictures with friends between Zune devices. Listen to the full track of any song you receive up to three times over three days. 
If you like a song you hear and want to buy it, you can flag it right on your device and easily purchase it from the Zune Marketplace. 
Zune makes it easy to find music you love - whether it's songs in your existing library or new music from the Zune Marketplace. Easily import your existing music, 
pictures and videos in many popular formats and browse millions of songs on Zune Marketplace, where you can choose to purchase tracks individually or to buy a 
Zune Pass subscription to download as many songs as you want for a flat fee. 
To get started with great music and videos out of the box, every Zune device is preloaded with content from record labels such as DTS, EMI Music's Astralwerks 
Records and Virgin Records, Ninja Tune, Playlouderecordings, Quango Music Group, Sub Pop Records, and V2/Artemis Records.
</p>
<p><b>Zune Accessories</b></p>
<p>
To enhance the Zune experience, three accessory packs help Zune users enjoy their music where they want to, at home or on the road. The packs and the individual accessories, 
all designed exclusively for Zune, will be available at launch:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Zune Car Pack</b> includes everything needed to hit the road with a Zune device, such as the built-in FM tuner with AutoSeek and the Zune Car Charger.</li>
<li><b>The Zune Home A/V Pack</b> enhances your experience in the home through five products that integrate Zune with the TV and music speakers: Zune AV Output Cable, Zune Dock, Zune Sync Cable, Zune AC Adapter and the Zune Wireless Remote for Zune Dock.</li> 
<li><b>Zune Travel Pack</b> is a set of five products designed to keep friends and family entertained on the road: Zune Premium Earphones, Zune Dual Connect Remote, Zune Gear Bag, Zune Sync Cable and the Zune AC Adapter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing consumers with additional options to customize and personalize their Zune experience, Microsoft is also working with leading accessory manufacturers 
Altec Lansing, Belkin Corp., Digital Lifestyle Outfitters (DLO), Dual Electronics, Griffin Technology, Harman Kardon and JBL, Integrated Mobile Electronics, 
Jamo International, Klipsch Audio Technologies, Logitech, Monster Cable Products Inc., Speck, Targus Group International Inc. and VAF Research
</p>
<p><b>The Future is Bright</b></p>
<p>
In addition to the features available at launch, built-in wireless technology and powerful software provide a strong foundation to continue to build new shared experiences around music and video. As Zune evolves, the device can be easily updated. 
The Zune software on your PC will let you know when these updates are available for download.
