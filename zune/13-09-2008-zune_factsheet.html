<img src="images/13-09-2008-zune_factsheet.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="Zune Device Family" class="article-image" />
<p><b>Zune portable media players.</b> Super slim and ultraportable, Zune players come in a variety of sizes and colors ranging from 4 GB to 120 GB; 
Zune Pad touch controls (not available in 30GB size), a high-resolution colour screen, wireless capabilities and an FM tuner are included in every device. 
Tag songs from FM radio and use the built-in wireless feature to download music directly to your device, share music and pictures with friends, 
and wirelessly sync with your PC.
</p>
<p><b>Zune software.</b> Keep your music, video, photos and podcasts organised and easily accessible. Zune learns what you love and recommends music 
you will like and people who share your tastes. Even without a Zune device, the Zune software is a powerful, fun and free way to bring all your 
entertainment together on your Windows-powered PC. 
</p>

3.5 million songs, two-thirds of which are available as digital rights management (DRM)-free MP3s; 6,000 music videos; 2,000 TV shows; and more 
than 5,000 audio and video podcasts. 
</p>
