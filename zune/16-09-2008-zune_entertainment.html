<p><b>REDMOND, Wash. - Sept 16, 2008</b>
Zune, Microsoft Corp.'s end-to-end music and entertainment service, today released its much anticipated free software update that will bring new 
features to every Zune portable media player. Revealed last week, the new software will allow Zune users to wirelessly stream and download music 
from the Zune Marketplace store on the go; tag and purchase songs directly from the built-in FM radio; and tap into new, personalized music 
recommendations and programming. To allow customers to take full advantage of the new wireless functionality, Zune today announced that it is 
working with high-speed Internet access provider Wayport Inc. to deliver Zune users free, wireless access to the Zune Marketplace from more than 
9,800 participating McDonald's restaurants across the United States.
</p>
<p>
"Wayport is pleased to be working with Microsoft to make it easier for Zune users to access music on the go," said Dan Lowden, vice president of 
business development and marketing for Wayport. "Our ability to enable and manage applications and devices over converged networks creates exciting 
new opportunities for our clients to attract new customers whose digital lifestyle extends beyond their home and office."
</p>
<p><b>More Colours and Custom Designs</b></p>
<p>
Zune Originals, the online store designed to let consumers customise their Zune player with laser-engraved art and personal text, now also offers 
exclusive colour combinations. In addition to the recently announced Zune 16 and Zune 120 available in black at retailers nationwide,

In addition, Zune Originals is refreshing its collection of custom artwork with 14 eye-catching new designs from artists such as Rolito, 
MWM (Matt W. Moore), Ippei Gyoubu and Aya Kato to give consumers more options to personalise their Zune experience.

In addition to launching Zune Channels, which push new music to subscribers' collections each week, and personalised music recommendations, 
Zune Marketplace also offers editorial features such as the Zune School Music Masters Program and the Xbox Gamer Central pages,
