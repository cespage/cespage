<p class="article-strap">Zune device to retail for $249.99.</p>
<p class="article-folio">By <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/sep06/09-28ZunePricingAvailabilityPR.mspx">Microsoft Corporation</a>, Published 15th November 2006</p>
<p><b>REDMOND, Wash. - Sept. 28, 2006</b>
Microsoft Corp. is putting the social into digital music, starting this holiday. Today the company announced that the
Zune&trade; digital media player and online service will be available to consumers in the U.S. on Nov. 14, 2006, just in time for the holidays. 
The Zune device will retail for $249.99 U.S. (ERP) and will create new ways for entertainment fans to connect and share media experiences device-to-device 
through the use of wireless technology and new software scenarios.<br/>
For $249.99, consumers will get an incredible entertainment experience right out of the box: 
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>30GB digital media player</b> will come equipped with wireless functionality for Zune-to-Zune sharing of music, pictures and home recordings; a bright, 
three-inch LCD video screen that works in portrait or landscape mode to view pictures and videos; and a built-in FM tuner. The device will be available in three 
colours: black, brown and white.</li>
<li><b>A selection of preloaded content</b> including songs, music videos and film shorts are installed on the device's hard drive to help 
consumers discover new artists and entertainment.</li> 
</ul>
<p>
Zune makes it easy to find music you love - whether it's songs in your existing library or new music from the Zune Marketplace:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Its dynamic music service</b> will be continually updated with new content and experiences so there is always something to discover. 
The Zune Marketplace lets users browse and purchase songs individually.</li>
<li><b>A Zune Pass</b> subscription gives consumers access to millions of songs for $14.99 per month.</li> 
<li><b>Users can purchase songs individually</b> using Microsoft&reg; Points for 79 points per track. Similar to a pre-paid phone card, Microsoft Points is a stored value 
system that can be redeemed at a growing number of online stores, including the Xbox Live&reg; Marketplace.</li> 
</ul>
<p>
In addition, consumers can choose from a full line of accessories to enhance the Zune experience and help Zune users enjoy their entertainment where they want to, 
at home or on the road. Accessories range in price from $19.99 to $99.99.
</p>
<p>
"On Nov. 14 we're delivering not only a device, but a shared, social experience that will be shaped by the collective imagination of consumers," 
said Chris Stephenson, general manager of global marketing for Zune. "We're infusing the spirit of discovery and sharing into everything we do - 
from the experience we crafted around the device and service to pre-loading music and videos on every device to expose people to something new."
</p>
<p><b>Pre-Loaded Content</b></p>

Zune is a vehicle to explore new sounds and experiences. With that in mind, Microsoft pre-loaded each Zune device with a variety of songs and music videos
