<p class="article-strap">With Halo 2 coming soon to these shores in November we take a look into what could be the best game ever for any console - single and multi-player</p>

<p>Halo 2 launches in the UK on November 11th or two days earlier for those living in the United States. As Bungie, the developers of Halo 2 work hard 
to get the game released on time let us take a look at what you should expect from this great game.</p>
<p><b>History</b></p>
<p>
First of this game is the sequel to the original Halo: Combat Evolved, the game that defined the Xbox and the measure by which all other games on the platform are 
compared. That's a lot to live up to for any game and even more so for this sequel, in a departure from the last game you get to actually see Earth, unfortunately 
it is under attack from Covenant forces who want to wipe out humanity.<br/>
These aliens were in the previous game as a ship from Earth tried to get away from a battle they encounter the ring world that would be later known as Halo with 
hundreds of Covenant forces and other more dangerous life forms lurking within it's great structure
</p>
<p><b>Save Humanity</b></p>
<p>
The Covenant forces are now attacking Earth and your job as Master Chief is to help save Earth - no easy task. With your enhanced armour and weaponry this 
should makes things a lot easier including some new abilities not available in the previous game.<br/>
These new abilities include higher jumping, duel-wielding (meaning you can shoot two weapons at the same time in either hand) plus improved assistance from 
the Marines such as finding cover and support. However the Covenant also have new abilities their Ghost vehicle features a new boost facility and is now 
destructible even when riding it yourself, as are the human vehicles also.
</p>
<p><b>Single Player</b></p>
<p>
There is not much information about this mode at the moment but you will visit Earth, Alien space stations orbiting gas giants and even the wreckage of Halo 
from the previous game. Shoot your way through a tight spot or shoot out lights and sneak past enemies who will hunt you down if they hear or see you.
</p>
<p><b>Multi Player</b></p>
<p>
With the announcement of the release of Halo 2 was a demo of the multiplayer mode in a new map based on Earth called Zanzibar this is a power generation 
facility allowing great vehicle, sniping and general shoot-out action. This map is huge and allows many players to participate, but even better is that you 
can play this map and others on Xbox Live with people from all around the world.<br/>
Modes include Capture the Flag and King of the Hill plus team up with your own clans with customisable Armour and symbols to set you apart from your rivals. 
</p>
<p><b>Release</b></p>
<p>
This game will again redefine the Xbox with new features including Xbox Live, more multiplayer action and destructible vehicles and environments set on Earth, 
Space and Halo...
