<p><b>X05 Amsterdam</b></p>
<p>
A 19th-century industrial plant in Amsterdam was transformed into a sizzling showcase for the Xbox 360 video game and entertainment system from Microsoft Corp. 
on Oct. 4 and 5 as more than 1,000 members of the press and retail representatives gathered to get the definitive lowdown on the Xbox 360 launch for Europe and 
North America at X05, the Xbox brand experience for the games and entertainment industry. 
</p>
<p>
X05 was the backdrop for several major announcements, proving that Xbox - and partners - are ready to revolutionize gaming and entertainment with their 
next-generation-defining video games and entertainment system, Xbox 360. The biggest news was game-related, with Xbox taking the opportunity to confirm 
the fantastic titles that will be coming to the platform before Christmas 2005, as well as revealing some of the more than 200 new titles in development 
for Xbox 360.
</p>
<p>
Peter Moore, corporate vice president of Worldwide Marketing and Publishing for Xbox at Microsoft, also announced that triple Academy Award winners 
Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh will serve as the executive producers of "Halo," the upcoming feature film based on Microsoft's phenomenally popular video game. 
This unique alliance between Universal Studios, 20th Century Fox, Microsoft, and Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh promises a step forward in motion picture production. 
"Halo" will benefit from the experience and resources of the film studios, from Microsoft's groundbreaking vision and from Jackson's and Walsh's creative 
sensibilities and expertise in both traditional filmmaking and the world of emerging digital technologies.
</p>
<p>
Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) Executive Vice President and General Manager of International Publishing Gerhard Florin took to the stage to announce the Xbox 360 
exclusive "FIFA 06: Road to FIFA World Cup" and confirm "Godfather," "Burnout" and "Battlefield" - along with a new franchise, "Superman" - as coming soon to Xbox 360. 
Ubisoft Entertainment chose X05 to announce the return of Sam Fisher in "Splinter Cell 4." In addition, id Software Inc. CEO Todd Hollenshead revealed the seminal 
"Castle Wolfenstein" for Xbox 360.
"This is the start of a new era in interactive entertainment," Florin said. "The combined power of Xbox 360 and innovation from EA in graphics, animation and 
gameplay means consumers will have unprecedented levels of interaction and rich connection with the games they play. EA has more than 20 games in development 
for Xbox 360 and is delivering quality entertainment in support of the launch with franchises like 'Need for Speed,' 'FIFA,' 'NBA Live,' 'Tiger Woods' and 
'Madden NFL.' Today's X05 event is a global showcase of great digital entertainment to come."
</p>
<p>
The press conference also provided the perfect forum for Xbox Vice President J Allard to demonstrate the seamless integration and enhanced offering of the 
Xbox Live service with Xbox 360 - and with other electronic devices in the home - heralding the beginning of next-generation online gaming and online 
entertainment. From playing music files from an iPod to personalizing gameplay by buying car parts from Xbox Live Marketplace in Project Gotham Racing 3 
to features such as Family Settings and Enhanced Matchmaking, Xbox Live is expanding the limits of what is possible.
</p>
<p><b>The Greatest Games</b></p>
<p>
Previous X0 events have been a highlight of the gaming industry calendar, and X05 proved no different. The biggest names in publishing announced exclusive 
Xbox 360 games as well as new additions to best-selling franchises. The holiday season promises gamers a choice of titles and genres that demonstrates the 
dazzling power and versatility of the platform, including Perfect Dark Zero and Kameo: Elements of Power (Rare Ltd.), Project Gotham Racing 3 
(Bizarre Creations Ltd.), and Dead or Alive 4 (Tecmo Ltd.).
Exclusive Xbox 360 titles announced at X05 include Crackdown (MGS-Real Time Worlds), Too Human (MGS-Silicon Knights), Mass Effect (MGS-BioWare Corp.), 
and FIFA 06: Road to FIFA World Cup (Electronic Arts).
</p>
<p>
New editions to blockbuster franchises announced for the first time include Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend (Eidos Interactive Ltd.), Splinter Cell 4 
(Ubisoft Entertainment), Castle Wolfenstein (id Software) and Superman (Electronic Arts) - all certain to look and play their best on Xbox 360. 
</p>
<p>
"Xbox 360 is the world's most powerful high-definition video game and entertainment system, delivering the best games and the next generation of Xbox Live," 
said Robbie Bach, president of the Entertainment and Devices Division and chief Xbox officer at Microsoft Corp. "In addition, as the ultimate digital amplifier 
in the home, Xbox 360 will enable consumers to connect to digital cameras, portable music players and Windows® XP-based PCs to enjoy integrated entertainment 
experiences that simply can't be matched."
