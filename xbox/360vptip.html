Viva Piñata: Trouble in Paradise, the newest piñata adventure that invites gamers to return to magical Piñata Island. Unfortunately, 
not all is well on the island, as Professor Pester along with his gang of Ruffians have wiped out Piñata Central's computer records, 
which poses a threat to parties everywhere. To help Piñata Central, players must gradually rebuild the computer database by sending 
piñatas at full candiosity to parties all around the world. While thwarting Professor Pester's evil plot, players still build and 
maintain piñata gardens - using their creativity and imagination to attract, trap, protect, train and manage more than 100 
different piñata species.

<b>Gameplay</b>&nbsp;
-	Viva Piñata: Trouble in Paradise also offers a vast level of customization within your main garden. Now, along with planting grass, 
trees and flowers, and digging ponds and lakes, players can place sand and snow in their garden to make exotic species of piñata feel 
more at home. Players also can choose to enhance their garden with themed object packs - make your garden into a space centre, 
a pirate cove or a haunted graveyard. Buy objects to change the weather, or new toys for your piñata to play with. 
You have total freedom to create any kind of paradise you want! Thirty-two new species of piñata can run, crawl, fly and swim into your 
garden in Viva Piñata: Trouble in Paradise. Large, small, fierce and cute, the new piñatas will join all your favourites for thriving 
activity throughout your garden. Among these new species are sour piñatas that will infiltrate and wreak havoc in the garden. 
In Viva Piñata: Trouble in Paradise, players can choose to either tame sours, or feed them candy to keep them sweet.
</p>
<p>
<b>World</b>&nbsp;
-	Designed for beginner players, kids and those just looking to explore Piñata Island, this mode allows players to jump into the garden 
and interact with the unique piñata world. In this mode the difficulty has been turned down and the fun has been turned up. 
Sour piñatas stay away, resident piñatas remain healthy, weeds don't plague your garden and you have an infinite chocolate 
coin bank account, allowing you to turn your garden into a veritable utopia of colorful creatures. Presenting a challenge for experienced 
piñata gardeners and dedicated gamers, the Standard gameplay mode provides a more tricky option, where players must keep a watchful 
eye on their garden. Sour piñatas, feuding species, weeds, illness and limited money call for you to exercise problem solving and 
creativity to build and maintain an environment where piñatas can flourish and grow.
</p>
<p>
<b>Spontaneous</b>&nbsp;
- Pester knows where your garden is, and he's got a few nasty tricks up his sleeve to make piñata life difficult. Foil his 
plans by sending your piñata around the world to save parties everywhere. Also, you must deal with new, untamed sour piñatas 
with bad attitudes and more troublesome Ruffians who will try to spoil your creation. Pester will try to block piñatas from 
ever reaching your garden, but you can break the blockades and teach him who is in charge on Piñata Island. However, don't 
underestimate Pester - he's likely to make some personal appearances to attempt to put you in your place. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Social</b>&nbsp;
- The world of Piñata Island is an inviting and rewarding place to be. Family members and friend now can share in the joy of 
creating a garden by simply plugging in an extra controller. The second player has access to all tools, actions and activities, 
but he or she also can collect magic by helping. Player two can spend magic by tinkering items, healing a sick piñata or filling 
a piñata candiosity meter. It's a new way to play. Using the new photo mode in Viva Piñata: Trouble in Paradise, you can snap, 
print and upload pictures of your unique garden or customized piñatas showing them off to your friends. You also can photograph 
your piñata and turn it into a piñata card, share it with your friends so they scan it and put it into their own garden using 
the Xbox LIVE Vision camera.
