role playing game of epic proportions in development for over two years. Oblivion features some great innovations such as Radiant AI where Non Playable 
Characters go about their business on their own, they have specific goals and schedules and perform tasks such as going to bed, eating food allowing NPCs 
to come to life as never before.<br/>
Oblivion is a single player game where you are given the hidden heir to a throne that sits empty, the previous emperor having been killed by an unknown assassin. 
With no true Emperor, the gates to Oblivion open, and demons begin to invade and attack. It's up to you to find the lost heir to the throne and unravel the sinister 
plot that threatens to destroy everything.
