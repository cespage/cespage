<p><b>Xbox 360 Launched</b></p>
<p>
10th December saw the launch of the Xbox 360 in Japan. If the console can succeed there then Microsoft can call these first three major launches a success, 
Japan being the region where the Xbox was least popular.<br/>
Other regions should receive the Xbox 360 in early 2006, with the South Pacific regions between February and March and Australasia in March 2006 so by mid 2006 
every region that had the original Xbox launched there should also have the Xbox 360 plus those in other regions who missed out on getting the console at launch.
CESPage.com Xbox have been playing on the Xbox 360 since the launch on December 2nd in Europe watch out for some reviews of the console, Perfect Dark Zero, 
Project Gotham Racing 3 plus some of the Xbox Live Arcade games like Hexic HD and Bejewelled 2. Feel free to send a message or game invite to the CESPage.com Xbox 
Gamertag : RoguePlanetoid.

<p><b>Xbox 360 Final Update</b></p>
<p>
CESPage.com Xbox Weekly Update Sixteen marks the last of the weekly updates designed to cover all the main news and rumours preceding the launch of the Xbox 360, 
articles and press releases will still be added from time to time, only this update will end.<br/>
To mark the end of the Weekly Update here is a review of each update, Update One started with the Origen Xbox 360 website which at the time was an unknown website
but later turned out to be a contest to win a VIP trip to the Xbox 360 launch event. Update Two saw a prediction of the possible launch dates with a launch on 
14th/19th of November for North America, Europe on the 25th of November and Japan on the 2nd of December, these dates were pretty accurate and only a few days or 
a week out! Update Three saw a countdown appear on the Bizarre Creations website this was for a later announcement of a project they are doing for SEGA. 
Update Four saw the announcement of the actual launch dates and a mention of how close CESPage.com Xbox was. Update Five saw the start of the countdown to the 
three main releases which have ended now. Update Six mentioned what Origen Xbox 360 was really for and mentioned the controversy from those in North America about 
this also.<br/>

Xbox 360 Kiosks now present in all major retailers but were just making an appearance at the time. Update Nine busted some rumours that were circulating on the 
Internet regarding the Xbox 360 console. Update Ten featured the CESPage.com Xbox Gamer Card and the Hex 168 contest which was a contest similar in prize to the 
Origen Xbox 360 contest thus the controversy over this stopped. Update Eleven mentioned the Xbox 360, 360 Hour Tour which CESPage.com Xbox attended which allowed
