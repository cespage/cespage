<p><b>Information</b></p>
<p>
Ending weeks of speculation about which upcoming video game platform will give gamers the most bang for their buck, today at the German Games Convention, 
Microsoft Corp. revealed that consumers can get their hands on Xbox 360 - the most powerful and feature-packed next-generation video game and entertainment 
system - for as little as $299.99 U.S./&euro;299.99/&pound;209.99 starting this holiday season. For gamers who want to experience the ultimate digital entertainment 
thrill ride, Microsoft also announced a model with hundreds of dollars worth of accessories for $399.99 U.S./&euro;399.99/&pound;279.99, giving consumers the definitive 
entertainment experience at an unbelievable value right out of the box.<br/>
The Xbox 360 and Xbox 360 Core System - along with an impressive lineup of high-definition game titles from the world's best publishers and developers - 
will make their debut in North America, Europe and Japan in time for this Christmas holiday, several months ahead of the competition. 
Although details for the Japan launch will be addressed at the Tokyo Game Show in September, the unprecedented three-region launch signifies an industry first. 
The Xbox 360 platform will deliver the most powerful console, the best games, the next generation of the Xbox Live service, and amazing digital entertainment 
experiences never seen in console entertainment.<br/>
"The sheer entertainment value of Xbox 360 cannot be overstated," said Robbie Bach, chief Xbox officer for Microsoft. 
"While the system has the muscle to power awe-inspiring graphics, audio and online play, it's also got the intelligence to serve as a one-of-a-kind entertainment 
device that plays CDs, DVDs, MP3s and digital content from an array of devices, including portable music players and digital cameras."
With its built-in Ethernet port and free Silver level of service right out of the box, Xbox 360 also connects players to Xbox Live, the premiere global online console 
games and entertainment network. With Xbox Live, gamers can chat with friends online, build and share gamer profiles, send and receive text and voice messages, 
and access Xbox Live Marketplace for new content such as game demos, trailers and casual games from Xbox Live Arcade. 
Subscribers to the Gold level of service will also enjoy access to online multiplayer gaming in their favorite games, 
as well as great promotional programs such as worldwide tournaments, the chance to play online with their favorite celebrities, and opportunities to win big prizes.
