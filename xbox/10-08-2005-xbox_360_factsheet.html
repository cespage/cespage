Available this holiday season in Europe, Japan, and North America, Xbox 360 ignites a new era of digital entertainment 
that is always connected, always personalised, and always in high definition.</p>

<p>
Xbox 360 gives you access to the games you want to play, the people you want to play with, and the experiences you crave-when and where you want them.
</p>
<p><b>Key Highlights</b></p>
<p>
<b>Hardware, software, and services</b>: Unveiled to the world on MTV on Thursday, May 12, 2005, Xbox 360 represents a dramatic leap forward in high-definition 
gaming and entertainment experiences. Fusing powerful hardware, software, and services, Xbox 360 fully engages you in a gaming experience that is more 
expansive, dramatic, and lifelike, where the possibilities are limitless and your imagination knows no boundaries. The next generation is here. 
<br/><br/>
<b>Industrial design</b>: A merger of form and function, Xbox 360 wraps powerful technology in a sophisticated exterior. Two of the most innovative design 
firms in the world-San Francisco-based Astro Studios and Osaka, Japan-based Hers Experimental Design Laboratory Inc.-came together to craft a sleek, 
stylish system that conveys the very essence of Xbox 360.
<br/><br/> 
<b>Xbox Gamer Guide</b>: The Xbox Gamer Guide is an entertainment gateway that instantly connects you to your games, friends, music, movies, and downloadable content. 
Available at a touch of the Xbox Guide Button, the Xbox Gamer Guide gives you instant access to the experiences and content you want, from the gamer card of 
the player that just invited you to play online to new downloadable content for the game currently running. 
<br/><br/>
<b>Personalised interface</b>: Xbox 360 lets you create your own unique system and experience. With interchangeable Xbox 360 Faces, it's easy and fun to change the 
appearance of your console. Switch on your system and customise the look and feel of the Xbox Gamer Guide and Xbox System Guide with unique skins. 
From sleek and sophisticated to fun and funky, pick the Faces and skins that show your personality.
<br/><br/>
<b>Ring of Light and Xbox Guide Button</b>: Divided into four quadrants, the glowing Ring of Light and Xbox Guide Button visually connect you to your games, 
digital media, and the world of Xbox Live, the first global, unified online console games service. Featured on both the wireless and wired controllers, 
the Xbox Guide Button puts you in control of your experience. In addition to bringing up the Xbox Gamer Guide and the Xbox System Guide, the Xbox Guide Button 
lets you turn the system on and off without ever leaving the couch. 
<br/><br/>
<b>Xbox Live</b>: Xbox Live is where games and entertainment come alive, the only unified place where you can play with anyone, anytime, anywhere. 
And the best just got better. Connect your Xbox 360 to your broadband connection and get instant access to Xbox Live Silver. Express your digital identity through 
your Gamertag and gamer card, talk with others using voice chat, and access Xbox Live Marketplace-all right out of the box, at no extra cost. 
Upgrade to Xbox Live Gold and enter the exciting world of multiplayer online gaming. With intelligent matchmaking, access to all your achievements and statistics, 
video chat and video messaging, and an enormous selection of games, Xbox Live Gold delivers your competition, on your terms.
<br/><br/>
<b>Xbox Live Marketplace</b>: Keep your favorite games fresh with instant access to new content. Xbox Live Marketplace is a one-stop shop to download new game trailers, 
demos, and episodic content, plus new game levels, maps, weapons, vehicles, skins, and more. Accessible to everyone who establishes a broadband connection with their 
Xbox 360, Xbox Live Marketplace lets you personalise and extend your experience, on demand.
<br/><br/>
<b>Games</b>: Xbox 360 redefines what games look like, sound like, feel like, and play like to engage you like never before. With Xbox 360, epic worlds are alive with 
detail, from thunderous skies rumbling over a mountain range to tiny blades of grass rustling together in the breeze. Vibrant characters display depth of emotion 
to evoke more dramatic responses, immersing you in the experience like never before. You'll see all Xbox 360 titles at 720p resolution in 16:9 widescreen, 
with anti-aliasing for smooth, movie-like graphics and multi-channel surround sound.
<br/><br/> 
<b>Digital entertainment</b>: Amplify your music, photos, video, and TV. Watch progressive-scan DVD movies right out of the box. Rip music to the Xbox 360 hard drive 
and share your latest digital pictures with friends. Make the connection, and Xbox 360 instantly streams the digital media stored on your MP3 player, digital camera, 
Media Center PC, or any Microsoft Windows XP-based PC.
