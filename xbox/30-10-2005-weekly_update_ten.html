early December, this week's accessory is the Xbox 360 Wireless Controller.
The Xbox 360 Wireless Controller is the first time that a console has shipped with a first party wireless controller in the box at launch. The controller 
features a proprietary wireless technology that allows it to work up to 10 metres from the console. The controller can even be used to turn the console off 
also with the Xbox Guide button which also accesses the feature on the console for Friends list and other player global settings.

directional pad. There are also new left and right shoulder buttons are designed for ease of use that replaces the black and white buttons from the first Xbox.
