<p><b>Another Internet Countdown</b></p>
<p>
Another mysterious countdown appeared on the Internet again, there was much speculation including theories that it counted down to the announcement of Halo 3, 
which seems to be the thought every single time, Bungie will announce this title when it is ready! However this was in fact a contest for those living in the 
United States to get their hands on the Xbox 360 console for free similar to the Origen Xbox 360 competition but not only do they get to go to an event but win 
an Xbox 360, which in Europe there is no such competition.<br/>
The competition is a skill contest where participants submit a photograph or video showing "the power of hex" with only one entry per person this has to be 
something original and not just the mundane to win the chance to have the Xbox 360 console first.
